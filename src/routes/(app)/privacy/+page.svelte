		<h1>Privacy Policy for Telephone Bot</h1>

		<p>
			This privacy policy applies to the Telephone bot ("Telephone," "we," "us," or "our") and
			explains how we collect, use, and share your information.
		</p>

		<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

		<p>
			Telephone does not collect or store any personal information from users. The only information
			we collect is related to the settings of the guilds where the bot is active. This information
			is only used for the purpose of connecting the voice channels and is not shared or used for
			any other purpose.
		</p>

		<h2>Voice Data</h2>

		<p>
			Telephone does not record or store any voice data that is transmitted through the bot. Voice
			data is transmitted directly between the voice channels and is not stored or recorded by
			Telephone.
		</p>

		<h2>Sharing of Information</h2>

		<p>
			Telephone does not share any information with third parties. The information we collect is
			only used to connect the voice channels and is not shared or used for any other purpose.
		</p>

		<h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>

		<p>
			The data associated with your use of Telephone is retained on our servers for as long as you
			or your server continues to use the bot. If you or the server "kicks" the bot, this data will
			be deleted from our servers.
		</p>

		<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

		<p>
			We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by
			posting the new privacy policy on this page.
		</p>
